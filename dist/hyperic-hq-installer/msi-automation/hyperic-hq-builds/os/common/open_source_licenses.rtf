\par 
\par <li>
\par <strong>"Collective Work"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical issue, 
anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collec
tive Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
\par </li>
\par 
\par <li>
\par <strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> 
means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other 
f
orm in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical compositi
on or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li>

b
le manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship cre
dit.

\par       ============================
\par 
\par       Copyright (c) 2005 Bob Ippolito.  All rights reserved.
\par 
\par       This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:
\par 
\par       Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
\par 
\par       1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:
\par 
\par       a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;
\par 
\par       b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;
\par 
\par       c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;
\par 
\par       d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
\par 
\par       e) to display the Original Work publicly.
\par 
\par       2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under
 patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.
\par 
\par       3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source C
ode" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work
 
along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and 
convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
\par 
\par       
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without expre
s
s prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license i
s
 granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this Lice
nse shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
\par 
\par       5) This section intentionally omitted.
\par 
\par       6) Attribution Rights. You mus
t retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution 
Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.
\par 
\par       7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of 
Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of th
o
se copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the wa
r
ranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is
 granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.
\par 
\par       8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or an
y
 and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allo
w the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
\par 
\par       9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
 effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the 
O
riginal Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalen
t laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.
\par 
\par       10) Termination for Patent Action
. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the
 Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.
\par 
\par       11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or su
it relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The applicat
i
on of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U
.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.  101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
\par 
\par       12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking
 damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This sec
tion shall survive the termination of this License.
\par 
\par       13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
 only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
\par 
\par       14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of th
e terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or man
agement of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
\par 
\par       15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

\par 
\par       <ol type="a">
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       <strong>"Collective W
ork"</strong> means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled i
nto a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       <strong>"Derivative Work"</strong> means a work based upon the Work
 or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be re
c
ast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synch
ronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       <strong>"Licensor"</strong> means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       <strong>"Original Author"</strong> means the individual or entity who created the Work.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       <strong>"Work"</strong> means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       <strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this Li
cense with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
\par 
\par       </li>
\par       </ol>
\par 
\par       <p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is 
intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. </p>
\par 
\par 
\par       <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject
 to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: </p>
\par 
\par 
\par       <ol type="a">
\par       <li>
\par 
\par       to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

\par       to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
\par       </li>

\par 
\par       <li>
\par       to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

\par 
\par       <li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:</p>
\par 
\par       <ol type="i">
\par       <li><strong>Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses</strong>. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public perfor
mance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.</li>
\par 
\par       <li><strong>Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agen
t (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).</li></o
l></li>
\par 
\par       <li><strong>Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties</strong>. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. So

\par 
\par 
\par       <p>The abov
e rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not express
ly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>
\par 
\par       <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong>The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: </p>
\par 
\par 
\par       <ol type="a">
\par       <li>
\par       You may dis
tribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You d
i
stribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublic
e
nse the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control 
a
ccess or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to 
t
he terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
 from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utili
z
ing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's 
c
opyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated w
i
th the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Orig
i
nal Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any o
ther comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       </ol>
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par       <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>
\par 
\par       <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE
 MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHAN
T
IBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUC
H EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
\par 
\par 
\par       <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIV
E OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. </p>
\par 
\par       <p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>
\par 
\par       <ol type="a">
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       This License and the
 rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses t
erminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license g
ranted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however t
hat any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

\par       </li>
\par       </ol>
\par 
\par       <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>
\par 
\par       <ol type="a">
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder
 of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
\par 
\par       </li>
\par 
\par       <li>
\par       This License constitutes the entire agreemen
t between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communica
tion from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

\par SOFTWARE RIGHTS
\par 
\par ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr
\par Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com
\par 
\par We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
\par public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
\par they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
\par code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
\par ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.
\par 
\par We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
\par we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
\par ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
\par incorporate any source code into one of your programs
\par (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
\par you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
\par research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
\par developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
\par you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
\par headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
\par guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
\par system and expect to make other tools available as they are
\par completed.

\par 
\par Roo is copyright (C) 2008-2010 SpringSource Inc. All Rights Reserved.
\par 
\par Roo is licensed under the GPLv3: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html
\par 
\par The contents of roo-annotations-*.jar are dual licensed under both the
\par GPLv3 and also the Apache License, Version 2.0:
\par 
\par http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html.
\par 
\par You may apply your choice of GPLv3 or ASLv2 to your use of the
\par roo-annotations-*.jar file.
\par 
\par Ensuring an ASLv2 license is provided for the roo-annotations-*.jar
\par file is SpringSource's reassurance that we do not intend for GPLv3
\par obligations to extend to people simply using Roo to build software.
\par 
\par In connection with the annotations, we further note:
\par 
\par 1. The annotations are source level retention only. As such there is
\par no requirement for the roo-annotations-*.jar file to be present
\par in your classpath at runtime. The annotations are not even
\par referred to in your compiled .class files.
\par 
\par 2. Roo itself is a development time only tool. No Roo JARs whatsoever
\par are required by your project at runtime.
\par 
\par We trust the above clarifies our application of GPLv3 to Roo and that it
\par is not intended to cause people simply wishing to use Roo any unexpected
\par GPLv3-related implications. We only intend that GPLv3 impacts those
\par wishing to improve, build on, redistribute, extend etc Roo itself.

\par 
\par Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below:
\par 
\par The "Artistic License"
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab \tab Preamble
\par 
\par The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
\par Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
\par semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
\par while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
\par the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
\par reasonable modifications.
\par 
\par Definitions:
\par 
\par \tab "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
\par \tab Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
\par \tab created through textual modification.
\par 
\par \tab "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
\par \tab modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
\par \tab of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
\par 
\par \tab "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
\par \tab copyrights for the package.
\par 
\par \tab "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
\par \tab this Package.
\par 
\par \tab "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
\par \tab basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
\par \tab and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
\par \tab Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
\par \tab as a market that must bear the fee.)
\par 
\par \tab "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
\par \tab itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
\par \tab It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
\par \tab under the same conditions they received it.
\par 
\par 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
\par Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
\par duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
\par 
\par 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
\par derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
\par modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
\par 
\par 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
\par that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
\par when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
\par following:
\par 
\par     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
\par     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
\par     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
\par     site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
\par     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
\par 
\par     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
\par 
\par     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
\par     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
\par     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
\par     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
\par 
\par     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
\par 
\par 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
\par executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
\par 
\par     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
\par     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
\par     to get the Standard Version.
\par 
\par     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
\par     the Package with your modifications.
\par 
\par     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
\par     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
\par     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
\par 
\par     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
\par 
\par 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
\par Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
\par Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
\par you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
\par commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
\par distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
\par product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
\par an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
\par form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
\par interpreter is so embedded.
\par 
\par 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
\par output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
\par under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
\par them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
\par Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
\par Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
\par binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
\par neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
\par fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
\par not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
\par Package.
\par 
\par 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
\par languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
\par emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
\par Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
\par equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
\par not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
\par regression tests for the language.
\par 
\par 8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
\par permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
\par when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
\par to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
\par construed as a distribution of this Package.
\par 
\par 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
\par products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

\par    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
\par 
\par    1. Definitions.

\par       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
\par       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

\par 
\par       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
\par       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
\par       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
\par       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
\par 
\par       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
\par       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
\par       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
\par       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
\par       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
\par       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
\par       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
\par 
\par       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
\par       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
\par       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

\par       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
\par       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
\par       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
\par       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

\par       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
\par       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
\par       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
\par       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
\par       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
\par 
\par    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

\par       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
\par       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
\par       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
\par       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
\par       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
\par       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
\par       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
\par       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
\par       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
\par       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
\par       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
\par       as of the date such litigation is filed.
\par 
\par    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
\par       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
\par       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
\par       meet the following conditions:
\par 
\par       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
\par           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
\par 
\par       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
\par           stating that You changed the files; and
\par 
\par       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
\par           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
\par           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
\par           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
\par           the Derivative Works; and
\par 
\par       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
\par           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
\par           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
\par           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
\par           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
\par           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
\par           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
\par           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
\par           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
\par           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
\par           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
\par           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
\par           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
\par           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
\par           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
\par           as modifying the License.
\par 
\par       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
\par       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
\par       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
\par       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
\par       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
\par       the conditions stated in this License.
\par 
\par    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
\par       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
\par       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
\par       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
\par       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
\par       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
\par       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
\par 
\par    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
\par       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
\par       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
\par       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
\par 
\par    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
\par       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
\par       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
\par       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
\par       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
\par       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
\par       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
\par       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
\par       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
\par 
\par    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
\par       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
\par       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
\par       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
\par       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
\par       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
\par       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
\par       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
\par       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
\par       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
\par       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
\par 
\par    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
\par       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
\par       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
\par       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
\par       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
\par       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
\par       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
\par       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
\par       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
\par       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

\par EXCEPTIONS-CONNECTOR-J:
\par 
\par MySQL FLOSS License Exception
\par 
\par The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source
\par Software-only Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the
\par "FLOSS Exception").
\par 
\par Version 0.6, 7 March 2007
\par 
\par Exception Intent
\par 
\par We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'')
\par applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
\par libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS
\par licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public
\par License (the ``GPL'').
\par 
\par Legal Terms and Conditions
\par 
\par As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0
\par of the GPL:
\par 
\par  1. You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed
\par     entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a
\par     "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses
\par     listed below in section 1, as long as:
\par       a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the
\par          Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the
\par          Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program,
\par          and which can reasonably be considered independent and
\par          separate works in themselves,
\par       b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which
\par          are not derived from the Program, and which can
\par          reasonably be considered independent and separate works
\par          in themselves,
\par            i. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses
\par               listed below, and
\par           ii. the object code or executable form of those sections
\par               are accompanied by the complete corresponding
\par               machine-readable source code for those sections on
\par               the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as
\par               the corresponding object code or executable forms of
\par               those sections, and
\par       c. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a
\par          Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution
\par          medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be
\par          considered independent and separate works in themselves
\par          which are not derivatives of either the Program, a
\par          Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
\par     If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only
\par     be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and
\par     conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from
\par     MySQL AB.

\par     require that any version follow the 2003 version of the Free
\par     Software Foundation's Free Software Definition
\par     (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or version 1.9 of

\par 
\par  3. Definitions
\par 
\par       a. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the
\par          meaning provided in the GPL.
\par       b. Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright
\par          law.
\par 
\par  4. Applicability: This FLOSS Exception applies to all Programs
\par     that contain a notice placed by MySQL AB saying that the
\par     Program may be distributed under the terms of this FLOSS
\par     Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a
\par     Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work
\par     licensed under the GPL, then this FLOSS Exception is not
\par     available for that work; thus, you must remove the FLOSS
\par     Exception notice from that work and comply with the GPL in all
\par     respects, including by retaining all GPL notices. You may
\par     choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under
\par     the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice
\par     from that copy of the Program, provided that the copy has
\par     never been modified by you or any third party.

\par Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
\par notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided
\par in the Appendix below).  
\par 
\par "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
\par that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
\par revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
\par as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this
\par License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
\par from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work
\par and Derivative Works thereof.
\par 
\par "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the

\par royalty- free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
\par license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
\par otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
\par patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
\par infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
\par their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
\par was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
\par (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
\par Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
\par or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
\par to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
\par such litigation is filed.

\par      notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
\par      that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
\par 
\par   d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
\par      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
\par      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
\par      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
\par      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
\par      the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part
\par      of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
\par      if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
\par      generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
\par      notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
\par      informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
\par      may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
\par      You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text

\par Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
\par submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
\par under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
\par terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
\par supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
\par have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
\par 
\par 6. Trademarks.
\par This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
\par service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
\par reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
\par reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
\par 
\par 7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
\par Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
\par provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on
\par an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
\par express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
\par conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR
\par A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
\par appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

\par of the possibility of such damages.
\par 
\par 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
\par While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
\par choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
\par indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
\par this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
\par on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
\par any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
\par hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
\par asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
\par warranty or additional liability.

\par 
\par \tab \tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par \tab \tab        Version 2, June 1991
\par 
\par  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
\par  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
\par  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\par  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\par 
\par [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
\par  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab     Preamble
\par 
\par   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
\par freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
\par Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
\par free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
\par 
\par   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
\par specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
\par other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
\par your libraries, too.
\par 
\par   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
\par price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
\par have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
\par this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
\par if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
\par in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
\par anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
\par These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
\par you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
\par 
\par   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
\par or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
\par you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
\par code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
\par complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
\par with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
\par it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
\par the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
\par permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
\par 
\par   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
\par that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
\par library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
\par want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
\par version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
\par the original authors' reputations.
\par 
\par   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
\par patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
\par software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
\par transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
\par we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
\par free use or not licensed at all.
\par 
\par   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
\par GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
\par license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
\par designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
\par one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
\par the same as in the ordinary license.
\par 
\par   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
\par they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
\par program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
\par changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
\par analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
\par a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
\par derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
\par treats it as such.
\par 
\par   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
\par Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
\par sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
\par concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
\par 
\par   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
\par users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
\par libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
\par permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
\par preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
\par libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
\par this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
\par changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
\par will lead to faster development of free libraries.
\par 
\par   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
\par "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
\par former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
\par works together with the library.
\par 
\par   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
\par General Public License rather than by this special one.
\par 
\par \tab \tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par 
\par   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
\par contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
\par party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
\par General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
\par addressed as "you".
\par 
\par   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
\par prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
\par (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
\par 
\par   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
\par which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
\par Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
\par copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
\par portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
\par straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
\par included without limitation in the term "modification".)
\par 
\par   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
\par making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
\par all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
\par interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
\par and installation of the library.
\par 
\par   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
\par covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
\par running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
\par such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
\par on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
\par writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
\par and what the program that uses the Library does.
\par   
\par   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
\par complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
\par you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
\par appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
\par all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
\par warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
\par Library.
\par 
\par   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
\par and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
\par fee.
\par 
\par   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
\par of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
\par distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
\par 
\par     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
\par     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
\par 
\par     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
\par     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
\par     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
\par     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
\par     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
\par     in the event an application does not supply such function or
\par     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
\par     its purpose remains meaningful.
\par 
\par     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
\par     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
\par     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
\par     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
\par     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
\par     root function must still compute square roots.)
\par 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
\par identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
\par and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
\par themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
\par sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
\par distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
\par on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
\par this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
\par entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
\par it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
\par your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
\par exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
\par collective works based on the Library.
\par 
\par In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
\par with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
\par a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
\par the scope of this License.
\par 
\par   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
\par License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
\par this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
\par that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
\par instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
\par ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
\par that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
\par these notices.
\par 
\par   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
\par that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
\par subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
\par 
\par   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
\par the Library into a program that is not a library.
\par 
\par   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
\par derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
\par under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
\par it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
\par must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
\par medium customarily used for software interchange.
\par 
\par   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
\par from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
\par source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
\par distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
\par compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par 
\par   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
\par Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
\par linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
\par work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
\par therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
\par 
\par   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
\par creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
\par contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
\par library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
\par Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
\par 
\par   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
\par that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
\par derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
\par Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
\par linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
\par threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
\par 
\par   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
\par structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
\par functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
\par file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
\par work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
\par Library will still fall under Section 6.)
\par 
\par   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
\par distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
\par Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
\par whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
\par 
\par   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
\par link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
\par work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
\par under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
\par modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
\par engineering for debugging such modifications.
\par 
\par   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
\par Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
\par this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
\par during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
\par copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
\par directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
\par of these things:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
\par     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
\par     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
\par     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
\par     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
\par     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
\par     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
\par     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
\par     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
\par     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
\par     to use the modified definitions.)
\par 
\par     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
\par     least three years, to give the same user the materials
\par     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
\par     than the cost of performing this distribution.
\par 
\par     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
\par     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
\par     specified materials from the same place.
\par 
\par     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
\par     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
\par 
\par   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
\par Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
\par reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
\par the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
\par distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
\par components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
\par which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
\par the executable.
\par 
\par   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
\par restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
\par accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
\par use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
\par distribute.
\par 
\par   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
\par Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
\par facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
\par library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
\par the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
\par permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
\par     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
\par     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
\par     Sections above.
\par 
\par     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
\par     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
\par     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
\par 
\par   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
\par the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
\par attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
\par distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
\par rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
\par or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
\par terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
\par signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
\par distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
\par prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
\par modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
\par Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
\par all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
\par the Library or works based on it.
\par 
\par   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
\par Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
\par original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
\par subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
\par restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
\par You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
\par this License.
\par 
\par   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
\par infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
\par conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
\par otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
\par excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
\par distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
\par License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
\par may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
\par license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
\par all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
\par the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
\par refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
\par particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
\par and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
\par 
\par It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
\par patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
\par such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
\par integrity of the free software distribution system which is
\par implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
\par generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
\par through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
\par system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
\par to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
\par impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
\par be a consequence of the rest of this License.
\par 
\par   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
\par certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
\par original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
\par an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
\par so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
\par excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
\par written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
\par versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
\par Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
\par but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
\par specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
\par "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
\par conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
\par the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
\par license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
\par the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
\par programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
\par write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
\par copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
\par Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
\par decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
\par of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
\par and reuse of software generally.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab     NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
\par WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
\par EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
\par OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
\par KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
\par IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
\par PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
\par LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
\par THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
\par WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
\par AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
\par FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
\par CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
\par LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
\par RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
\par FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
\par SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
\par DAMAGES.

\par 
\par            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
\par 
\par   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
\par possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
\par everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
\par redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
\par ordinary General Public License).
\par 
\par   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
\par safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
\par convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
\par "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
\par     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
\par 
\par     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
\par     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
\par     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
\par     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
\par 
\par     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
\par     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
\par     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
\par     Library General Public License for more details.
\par 
\par     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
\par     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
\par     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
\par school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
\par necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
\par 
\par   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
\par   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

\par 
\par \tab \tab   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par \tab \tab        Version 2.1, February 1999
\par 
\par  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
\par  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
\par  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\par  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\par 
\par [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
\par  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
\par  the version number 2.1.]
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab     Preamble
\par 
\par   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
\par freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
\par Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
\par free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
\par 
\par   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
\par specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
\par Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
\par can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
\par this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
\par strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
\par 
\par   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
\par not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
\par you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
\par for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
\par it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
\par it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
\par these things.
\par 
\par   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
\par distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
\par rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
\par you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
\par 
\par   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
\par or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
\par you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
\par code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
\par complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
\par with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
\par it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
\par library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
\par permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
\par 
\par   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
\par there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
\par modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
\par that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
\par author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
\par introduced by others.
\par 
\par   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
\par any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
\par effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
\par restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
\par any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
\par consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
\par 
\par   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
\par ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
\par General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
\par is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
\par this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
\par libraries into non-free programs.
\par 
\par   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
\par a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
\par combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
\par General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
\par entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
\par Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
\par the library.
\par 
\par   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
\par does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
\par Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
\par of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
\par are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
\par libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
\par special circumstances.
\par 
\par   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
\par encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
\par a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
\par allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
\par library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
\par case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
\par software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
\par 
\par   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
\par programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
\par free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
\par non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
\par operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
\par system.
\par 
\par   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
\par users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
\par linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
\par that program using a modified version of the Library.
\par 
\par   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
\par "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
\par former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
\par be combined with the library in order to run.
\par 
\par \tab \tab   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par 
\par   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
\par program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
\par other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
\par this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
\par Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par 
\par   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
\par prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
\par (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
\par 
\par   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
\par which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
\par Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
\par copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
\par portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
\par straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
\par included without limitation in the term "modification".)
\par 
\par   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
\par making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
\par all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
\par interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
\par and installation of the library.
\par 
\par   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
\par covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
\par running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
\par such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
\par on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
\par writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
\par and what the program that uses the Library does.
\par 
\par   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
\par complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
\par you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
\par appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
\par all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
\par warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
\par Library.
\par 
\par   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
\par and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
\par fee.
\par 
\par   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
\par of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
\par distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
\par 
\par     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
\par     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
\par 
\par     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
\par     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
\par     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
\par     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
\par     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
\par     in the event an application does not supply such function or
\par     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
\par     its purpose remains meaningful.
\par 
\par     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
\par     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
\par     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
\par     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
\par     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
\par     root function must still compute square roots.)
\par 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
\par identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
\par and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
\par themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
\par sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
\par distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
\par on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
\par this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
\par entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
\par it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
\par your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
\par exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
\par collective works based on the Library.
\par 
\par In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
\par with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
\par a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
\par the scope of this License.
\par 
\par   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
\par License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
\par this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
\par that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
\par instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
\par ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
\par that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
\par these notices.
\par 
\par   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
\par that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
\par subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
\par 
\par   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
\par the Library into a program that is not a library.
\par 
\par   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
\par derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
\par under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
\par it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
\par must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
\par medium customarily used for software interchange.
\par 
\par   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
\par from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
\par source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
\par distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
\par compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par 
\par   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
\par Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
\par linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
\par work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
\par therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
\par 
\par   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
\par creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
\par contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
\par library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
\par Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
\par 
\par   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
\par that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
\par derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
\par Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
\par linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
\par threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
\par 
\par   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
\par structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
\par functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
\par file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
\par work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
\par Library will still fall under Section 6.)
\par 
\par   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
\par distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
\par Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
\par whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
\par 
\par   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
\par link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
\par work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
\par under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
\par modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
\par engineering for debugging such modifications.
\par 
\par   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
\par Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
\par this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
\par during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
\par copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
\par directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
\par of these things:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
\par     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
\par     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
\par     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
\par     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
\par     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
\par     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
\par     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
\par     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
\par     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
\par     to use the modified definitions.)
\par 
\par     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
\par     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
\par     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
\par     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
\par     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
\par     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
\par     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
\par 
\par     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
\par     least three years, to give the same user the materials
\par     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
\par     than the cost of performing this distribution.
\par 
\par     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
\par     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
\par     specified materials from the same place.
\par 
\par     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
\par     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
\par 
\par   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
\par Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
\par reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
\par the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
\par normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
\par components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
\par which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
\par the executable.
\par 
\par   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
\par restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
\par accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
\par use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
\par distribute.
\par 
\par   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
\par Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
\par facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
\par library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
\par the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
\par permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
\par     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
\par     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
\par     Sections above.
\par 
\par     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
\par     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
\par     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
\par 
\par   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
\par the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
\par attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
\par distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
\par rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
\par or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
\par terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
\par signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
\par distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
\par prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
\par modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
\par Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
\par all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
\par the Library or works based on it.
\par 
\par   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
\par Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
\par original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
\par subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
\par restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
\par You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
\par this License.
\par 
\par   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
\par infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
\par conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
\par otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
\par excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
\par distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
\par License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
\par may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
\par license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
\par all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
\par the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
\par refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
\par particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
\par and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
\par 
\par It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
\par patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
\par such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
\par integrity of the free software distribution system which is
\par implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
\par generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
\par through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
\par system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
\par to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
\par impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
\par be a consequence of the rest of this License.
\par 
\par   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
\par certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
\par original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
\par an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
\par so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
\par excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
\par written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
\par versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
\par Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
\par but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
\par specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
\par "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
\par conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
\par the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
\par license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
\par the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
\par programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
\par write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
\par copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
\par Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
\par decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
\par of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
\par and reuse of software generally.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab     NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
\par WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
\par EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
\par OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
\par KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
\par IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
\par PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
\par LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
\par THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
\par WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
\par AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
\par FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
\par CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
\par LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
\par RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
\par FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
\par SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
\par DAMAGES.
\par 
\par \tab \tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
\par 
\par   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
\par possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
\par everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
\par redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
\par ordinary General Public License).
\par 
\par   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
\par safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
\par convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
\par "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
\par     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
\par 
\par     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
\par     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
\par     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
\par     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
\par 
\par     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
\par     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
\par     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
\par     Lesser General Public License for more details.
\par 
\par     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
\par     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
\par     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
\par school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
\par necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
\par 
\par   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
\par   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

\par     Modifications made by that Contributor.
\par 
\par 3. Distribution Obligations.
\par 
\par 3.1. Availability of Source Code.
\par 
\par Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
\par in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and
\par that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
\par License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
\par Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make
\par available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
\par Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source
\par Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
\par for software exchange.
\par 
\par 3.2. Modifications.
\par 
\par The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed
\par by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
\par Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
\par rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
\par 
\par 3.3. Required Notices.
\par 
\par You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies
\par You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter
\par any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
\par Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
\par attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
\par 
\par 3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
\par 
\par You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
\par Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
\par or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
\par charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
\par one or more recipients of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only
\par on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
\par Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
\par support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
\par You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
\par for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
\par as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
\par 
\par 3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
\par 
\par You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
\par terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
\par which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
\par in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
\par Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
\par in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If
\par You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
\par license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
\par from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
\par or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
\par every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
\par or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
\par 
\par 3.6. Larger Works.
\par 
\par You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
\par not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
\par as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
\par of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
\par 
\par 4. Versions of the License. 
\par 
\par 4.1. New Versions.
\par 
\par Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
\par revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
\par version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
\par in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
\par modify this License.
\par 
\par 4.2. Effect of New Versions.
\par 
\par You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
\par Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
\par which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
\par Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
\par from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
\par version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
\par available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
\par originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
\par to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
\par under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
\par the license steward.
\par 
\par 4.3. Modified Versions.
\par 
\par When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
\par for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of
\par this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references
\par to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license
\par differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
\par license contains terms which differ from this License.
\par 
\par 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
\par 
\par COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
\par WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
\par WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
\par DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
\par ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE
\par IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
\par YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
\par OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
\par WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
\par COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
\par 
\par 6. TERMINATION. 
\par 
\par 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
\par automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
\par such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
\par which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
\par this License shall survive.
\par 
\par 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
\par judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
\par Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
\par referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software
\par (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
\par or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
\par directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
\par granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
\par Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
\par Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
\par days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
\par at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such
\par 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
\par Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a
\par written agreement with Participant.
\par 
\par 6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
\par user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
\par hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
\par any distributor) shall survive termination.
\par 
\par 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
\par 
\par UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
\par NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
\par OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
\par OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
\par INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
\par LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
\par COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
\par OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
\par OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
\par FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
\par THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS
\par DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
\par DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
\par 
\par 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
\par 
\par The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
\par in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
\par software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and
\par "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in
\par 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
\par C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
\par Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
\par This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any
\par other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government
\par rights in computer software under this License.
\par 
\par 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
\par 
\par This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
\par hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
\par such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
\par enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
\par specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to
\par the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
\par jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to
\par this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
\par in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within
\par the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
\par including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
\par fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
\par Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any
\par law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
\par be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
\par You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
\par States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
\par regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise
\par make available any Covered Software.
\par 
\par 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
\par 
\par As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
\par responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
\par of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
\par with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
\par on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
\par constitute any admission of liability.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par --------------- SECTION 5: Academic Free License, V2.1 -----------
\par 
\par The Academic Free License v. 2.1
\par 
\par This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of 
\par authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the 
\par following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original 
\par Work:
\par 
\par Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1
\par 
\par 1) Grant of Copyright License.
\par Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
\par perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:

\par   b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the
\par      Original Work;
\par 
\par   c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to
\par      the public;
\par 
\par   d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

\par by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by
\par the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work
\par and Derivative Works.
\par 
\par 3) Grant of Source Code License.
\par The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for

\par machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with
\par each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.  Licensor
\par reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-
\par readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably
\par calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long
\par as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
\par the address of that information repository in a notice immediately
\par following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
\par 
\par 4) Exclusions From License Grant.
\par Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the
\par Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used
\par to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without

\par Work.  Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor
\par from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work
\par that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
\par 
\par 5) This section intentionally omitted.
\par 
\par 6) Attribution Rights.
\par You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You
\par create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source
\par Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
\par descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must
\par cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry
\par a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients
\par that You have modified the Original Work.
\par 
\par 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.
\par Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the
\par patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are
\par sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission
\par of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as
\par expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original

\par consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
\par or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages
\par for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
\par or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
\par liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
\par resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law
\par prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
\par or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
\par and limitation may not apply to You.
\par 
\par 9) Acceptance and Termination.
\par If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work,
\par You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the
\par express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else
\par but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
\par grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original
\par Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and
\par any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another
\par written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited
\par by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by
\par international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted
\par to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License
\par and all of its terms and conditions.
\par 
\par 10) Termination for Patent Action.
\par This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise
\par any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You
\par commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against
\par Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes
\par a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action
\par alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with
\par other software or hardware.
\par 
\par 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.
\par Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in
\par the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which
\par Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
\par jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application
\par of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
\par of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside
\par the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject
\par to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.

\par 
\par \tab \tab    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
\par 
\par  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
\par  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\par  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\par 
\par 
\par   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
\par the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
\par License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
\par 
\par   0. Additional Definitions.
\par 
\par   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
\par General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
\par General Public License.
\par 
\par   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
\par other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
\par 
\par   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
\par by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
\par Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
\par of using an interface provided by the Library.
\par 
\par   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
\par Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
\par with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
\par Version".
\par 
\par   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
\par Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
\par for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
\par based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
\par 
\par   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
\par object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
\par and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
\par Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
\par 
\par   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
\par 
\par   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
\par without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
\par 
\par   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
\par 
\par   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
\par facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
\par that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
\par facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
\par version:
\par 
\par    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
\par    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
\par    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
\par    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
\par 
\par    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
\par    this License applicable to that copy.
\par 
\par   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
\par 
\par   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
\par a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
\par code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
\par material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
\par layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
\par (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
\par 
\par    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
\par    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
\par    covered by this License.
\par 
\par    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
\par    document.
\par 
\par   4. Combined Works.
\par 
\par   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
\par taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
\par portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
\par engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
\par the following:
\par 
\par    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
\par    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
\par    covered by this License.
\par 
\par    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
\par    document.
\par 
\par    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
\par    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
\par    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
\par    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
\par 
\par    d) Do one of the following:
\par 
\par        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
\par        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
\par        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
\par        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
\par        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
\par        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
\par        Corresponding Source.
\par 
\par        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
\par        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
\par        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
\par        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
\par        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
\par        Version.
\par 
\par    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
\par    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
\par    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
\par    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
\par    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
\par    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
\par    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
\par    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
\par    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
\par    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
\par    for conveying Corresponding Source.)
\par 
\par   5. Combined Libraries.
\par 
\par   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
\par Library side by side in a single library together with other library
\par facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
\par License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
\par choice, if you do both of the following:
\par 
\par    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
\par    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
\par    conveyed under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
\par    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
\par    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
\par 
\par   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
\par 
\par   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
\par of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
\par versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
\par differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
\par Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
\par of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
\par applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
\par conditions either of that published version or of any later version
\par published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
\par received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
\par General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
\par General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
\par whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
\par apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
\par permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
\par Library.

\par       may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
\par       version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
\par       include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
\par       You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
\par       Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of

\par 
\par       Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
\par       be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this
\par       License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
\par       an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
\par       you made an Executable version available; and if made available
\par       via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
\par       at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
\par       available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
\par       of that particular Modification has been made available to such
\par       recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
\par       version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
\par       Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
\par 
\par    3.3. Description of Modifications.
\par 
\par       You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
\par       a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
\par       Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
\par       statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
\par       from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
\par       the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
\par       in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
\par       in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
\par 
\par    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
\par 
\par       (a) Third Party Claims.
\par 
\par           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
\par           party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
\par           the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
\par           2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
\par           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
\par           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
\par           will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
\par           after the Modification is made available as described in Section
\par           3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
\par           copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
\par           other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
\par           newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received
\par           the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
\par 
\par       (b) Contributor APIs.
\par 
\par           If Contributor's Modifications include an application
\par           programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent
\par           licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that
\par           API, Contributor must also include this information in the
\par           LEGAL file.
\par 
\par       (c)   Representations.
\par 
\par           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
\par           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
\par           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
\par           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
\par           by this License.
\par 
\par    3.5. Required Notices.
\par 
\par       You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
\par       Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a
\par       particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
\par       include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
\par       where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You
\par       created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
\par       Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also
\par       duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
\par       where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
\par       to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
\par       warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
\par       more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
\par       Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
\par       any Contributor.
\par 
\par       You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
\par       indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
\par       You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
\par       Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
\par       or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
\par       or liability terms You offer.
\par 
\par    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
\par 
\par       You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
\par       requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
\par       and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
\par       of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
\par       including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
\par       obligations of Section 3.2.  The notice must be conspicuously
\par       included in any notice in an Executable version, related
\par       documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'
\par       rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
\par       Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a
\par       license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
\par       this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
\par       of this License and that the license for the Executable version
\par       does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
\par       Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.
\par       If You distribute the Executable version under a different license
\par       You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
\par       from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
\par       Developer or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
\par       Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
\par       by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
\par       such terms You offer.
\par 
\par    3.7. Larger Works.
\par 
\par       You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
\par       code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
\par       Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
\par       the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
\par 
\par 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
\par 
\par    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
\par    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
\par    judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
\par    of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
\par    limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included
\par    in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with
\par    all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited
\par    by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
\par    detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
\par 
\par 5. Application of this License.
\par 
\par    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
\par    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
\par 
\par 6. Versions of the License.
\par 
\par    6.1. New Versions.
\par 
\par       Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish
\par       revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
\par       version will be given a distinguishing version number.
\par 
\par    6.2. Effect of New Versions.
\par 
\par       Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
\par       the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
\par       that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under
\par       the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
\par       Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
\par       terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
\par 
\par    6.3. Derivative Works.
\par 
\par       If You create or use a modified version of this License (which
\par       you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
\par       Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your
\par       license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL",
\par       "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase
\par       do not appear in your license (except to note that your license
\par       differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
\par       Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
\par       Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in
\par       the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor
\par       in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be
\par       deemed to be modifications of this License.)
\par 
\par 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
\par 
\par    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
\par    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
\par    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE
\par    IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
\par    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
\par    OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE
\par    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
\par    CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
\par    CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
\par    OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER
\par    EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
\par 
\par 8. TERMINATION.
\par 
\par    8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
\par       automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
\par       cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
\par       sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
\par       survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by
\par       their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
\par       License shall survive.
\par 
\par    8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
\par       (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
\par       a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
\par       file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
\par 
\par       (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
\par           infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
\par           such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
\par           License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
\par           prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
\par           notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant
\par           a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
\par           future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
\par           withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
\par           Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice,
\par           a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually
\par           agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
\par           is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
\par           under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the
\par           expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
\par 
\par       (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
\par           Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any
\par           patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant
\par           under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of
\par           the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
\par           Modifications made by that Participant.
\par 
\par    8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
\par       alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly
\par       or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved
\par       (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
\par       patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
\par       licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
\par       shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of
\par       any payment or license.
\par 
\par    8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all
\par       end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
\par       which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
\par       prior to termination shall survive termination.
\par 
\par 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
\par 
\par    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
\par    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
\par    DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
\par    OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
\par    ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
\par    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
\par    WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
\par    COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
\par    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
\par    LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
\par    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
\par    LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
\par    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
\par    SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
\par 
\par 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
\par 
\par    The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
\par    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
\par    software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as
\par    such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
\par    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
\par    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with
\par    only those rights set forth herein.
\par 
\par 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
\par 
\par    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
\par    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
\par    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
\par    necessary to make it enforceable.
\par 
\par    This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to
\par    the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
\par    conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least
\par    one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
\par    business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
\par    this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts
\par    of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa
\par    Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
\par    including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
\par    fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
\par    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
\par    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
\par    shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
\par 
\par 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
\par 
\par    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
\par    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
\par    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
\par    to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
\par    responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or
\par    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
\par 
\par 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
\par 
\par    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code
\par    as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial
\par    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
\par    Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
\par    by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

\par 
\par Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
\par 
\par THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
\par PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
\par OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
\par 1. DEFINITIONS
\par 
\par "Contribution" means:
\par 
\par     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
\par     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
\par 
\par     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
\par 
\par         i) changes to the Program, and
\par 
\par         ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or
\par         additions to the Program originate from and are distributed
\par         by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
\par         from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
\par         Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
\par         behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
\par         which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
\par         conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
\par         and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
\par 
\par "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
\par 
\par "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
\par are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
\par or when combined with the Program.
\par 
\par "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
\par Agreement.
\par 
\par "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
\par including all Contributors.
\par 
\par 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
\par 
\par     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
\par     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
\par     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
\par     publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
\par     Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
\par     object code form.
\par 
\par     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
\par     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
\par     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
\par     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
\par     if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
\par     shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
\par     if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
\par     addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
\par     by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
\par     other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
\par     se is licensed hereunder.
\par 
\par     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
\par     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
\par     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
\par     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
\par     Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
\par     any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
\par     or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
\par     granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
\par     to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
\par     example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
\par     Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
\par     to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
\par 
\par     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
\par     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
\par     license set forth in this Agreement.
\par 
\par 3. REQUIREMENTS
\par 
\par A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
\par under its own license agreement, provided that:
\par 
\par     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
\par 
\par     b) its license agreement:
\par 
\par         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
\par         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
\par         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
\par         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
\par         for a particular purpose;
\par 
\par         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
\par         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
\par         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
\par 
\par         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
\par         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
\par         party; and
\par 
\par         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
\par         such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
\par         reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
\par         software exchange.
\par 
\par When the Program is made available in source code form:
\par 
\par     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
\par 
\par     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
\par     the Program.  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright
\par     notices contained within the Program.
\par 
\par Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
\par Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
\par Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
\par 
\par 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
\par 
\par Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
\par with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
\par license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
\par Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
\par should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
\par other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
\par commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
\par hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
\par ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
\par (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
\par actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
\par the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
\par in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
\par product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any
\par claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
\par infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
\par promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
\par and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
\par the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
\par negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
\par claim at its own expense.
\par 
\par For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
\par product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
\par Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,
\par or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
\par warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under
\par this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
\par against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
\par warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
\par damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
\par 
\par 5. NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
\par ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
\par EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
\par CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
\par PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
\par the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes
\par all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement
\par , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
\par compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
\par equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
\par 
\par 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
\par 
\par EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
\par ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
\par INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
\par WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
\par LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
\par NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION
\par OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
\par ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par 7. GENERAL
\par 
\par If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
\par applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
\par the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
\par by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
\par extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
\par 
\par If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
\par a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
\par itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
\par hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
\par rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
\par litigation is filed.
\par 
\par All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
\par to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
\par and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
\par becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
\par this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
\par of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
\par obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
\par relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
\par 
\par Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
\par but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
\par only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
\par the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
\par from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
\par to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
\par Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve
\par as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
\par of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
\par Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
\par the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
\par after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect
\par to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new
\par version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
\par Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
\par any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
\par estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
\par under this Agreement are reserved.
\par 
\par This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
\par intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
\par this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
\par one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
\par to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

\par 
\par \tab \tab     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par \tab \tab        Version 2, June 1991
\par 
\par  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
\par  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
\par  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\par  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab     Preamble
\par 
\par   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
\par freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
\par License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
\par software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
\par General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
\par Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
\par using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
\par the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
\par your programs, too.
\par 
\par   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
\par price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
\par have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
\par this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
\par if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
\par in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
\par anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
\par These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
\par distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
\par 
\par   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
\par gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
\par you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
\par source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
\par rights.
\par 
\par   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
\par (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
\par distribute and/or modify the software.
\par 
\par   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
\par that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
\par software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
\par want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
\par that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
\par authors' reputations.
\par 
\par   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
\par patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
\par program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
\par program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
\par patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
\par 
\par   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par modification follow.
\par 
\par \tab \tab     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par 
\par   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
\par a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
\par under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
\par refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
\par means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
\par that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
\par either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
\par language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
\par the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par 
\par Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
\par covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
\par running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
\par is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
\par Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
\par Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
\par 
\par   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
\par source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
\par conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
\par copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
\par notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
\par and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
\par along with the Program.
\par 
\par You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
\par you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
\par 
\par   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
\par of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
\par distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
\par     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
\par 
\par     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
\par     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
\par     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
\par     parties under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
\par     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
\par     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
\par     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
\par     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
\par     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
\par     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
\par     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
\par     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
\par     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
\par 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
\par identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
\par and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
\par themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
\par sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
\par distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
\par on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
\par this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
\par entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
\par your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
\par exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
\par collective works based on the Program.
\par 
\par In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
\par with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
\par a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
\par the scope of this License.
\par 
\par   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
\par under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
\par Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
\par     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
\par     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
\par 
\par     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
\par     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
\par     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
\par     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
\par     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
\par     customarily used for software interchange; or,
\par 
\par     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
\par     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
\par     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
\par     received the program in object code or executable form with such
\par     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
\par 
\par The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
\par making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
\par code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
\par associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
\par control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
\par special exception, the source code distributed need not include
\par anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
\par form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
\par operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
\par itself accompanies the executable.
\par 
\par If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
\par access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
\par access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
\par distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
\par compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par 
\par   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
\par except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
\par otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
\par void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
\par However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
\par this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
\par parties remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
\par signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
\par distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
\par prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
\par modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
\par Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
\par all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
\par the Program or works based on it.
\par 
\par   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
\par Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
\par original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
\par these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
\par restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
\par You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
\par this License.
\par 
\par   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
\par infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
\par conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
\par otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
\par excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
\par distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
\par License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
\par may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
\par license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
\par all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
\par the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
\par refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
\par any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
\par apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
\par circumstances.
\par 
\par It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
\par patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
\par such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
\par integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
\par implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
\par generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
\par through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
\par system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
\par to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
\par impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
\par be a consequence of the rest of this License.
\par 
\par   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
\par certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
\par original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
\par may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
\par those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
\par countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
\par the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
\par of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
\par be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
\par address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
\par specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
\par later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
\par either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
\par Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
\par this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
\par Foundation.
\par 
\par   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
\par programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
\par to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
\par Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
\par make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
\par of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
\par of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab     NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
\par FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
\par OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
\par PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
\par OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
\par MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
\par TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
\par PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
\par REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
\par WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
\par REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
\par INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
\par OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
\par TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
\par YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
\par PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
\par POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par \tab \tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par \tab     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\par 
\par   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
\par possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
\par free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
\par 
\par   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
\par to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
\par convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
\par the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
\par     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
\par 
\par     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
\par     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
\par     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
\par     (at your option) any later version.
\par 
\par     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
\par     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
\par     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
\par     GNU General Public License for more details.
\par 
\par     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
\par     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
\par     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
\par when it starts in an interactive mode:
\par 
\par     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
\par     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
\par     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
\par     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
\par 
\par The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
\par parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
\par be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
\par mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
\par 
\par You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
\par school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
\par necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
\par 
\par   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
\par   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

\par 
\par This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
\par proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
\par consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
\par library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
\par Public License instead of this License.

\par 
\par BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
\par 
\par 1. Definitions
\par 
\par "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, an
thology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collecti
ve Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
\par 
\par "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatizatio
n, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be conside
r
ed a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivativ
e Work for the purpose of this License.
\par 
\par "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
\par 
\par "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who 
has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
\par 
\par 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
\par 
\par 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetu
al (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
\par 
\par     to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to   reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
\par     to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
\par     to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
\par     to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
\par 
\par For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
\par      Performance Royalties
 Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.

\par      
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover versio
n") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
\par     Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound reco
rding, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 
USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
\par 
\par The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are tech
nically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
\par 
\par 4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
\par 
\par     You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonore
cord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereun
d
er. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological
 
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
 
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Deriv
ative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.
\par     If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the 
Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/
o
r (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party o
r
 parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing informa
t
ion for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may
 
be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such o
ther comparable authorship credit.
\par 
\par 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
\par 
\par UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPR
ESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHE
R OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
\par 
\par 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF
 THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par 7. Termination
\par 
\par     This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who
 have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survi
ve any termination of this License.
\par     Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work u
nder different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License)
, and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
\par 
\par 8. Miscellaneous
\par 
\par     Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
\par     Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
\par     If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without fur
ther action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
\par     No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
\par     This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreemen
ts or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licenso
r and You.

\par --------------- SECTION 11: Common Public License, V1.0  -----------
\par 
\par 
\par Common Public License Version 1.0
\par 
\par THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
\par LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
\par CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
\par 
\par 1. DEFINITIONS
\par 
\par "Contribution" means:
\par 
\par     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
\par     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
\par 
\par     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
\par 
\par         i) changes to the Program, and
\par 
\par         ii) additions to the Program;
\par 
\par     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
\par     and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
\par     'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program
\par     by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
\par     behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
\par     (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
\par     with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
\par     not derivative works of the Program.
\par 
\par "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
\par 
\par "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
\par necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
\par combined with the Program.
\par 
\par "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
\par 
\par "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
\par including all Contributors.
\par 
\par 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
\par 
\par     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
\par     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
\par     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
\par     publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
\par     Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
\par     object code form.
\par 
\par     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
\par     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
\par     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
\par     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
\par     if any, in source code and object code form.  This patent license
\par     shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
\par     if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
\par     addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
\par     by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
\par     other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
\par     se is licensed hereunder.
\par 
\par     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
\par     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
\par     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
\par     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
\par     Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
\par     any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
\par     or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
\par     granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
\par     to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
\par     For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
\par     Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
\par     to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
\par 
\par     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
\par     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
\par     license set forth in this Agreement.
\par 
\par 3. REQUIREMENTS
\par 
\par A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
\par own license agreement, provided that:
\par 
\par     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
\par 
\par     b) its license agreement:
\par 
\par         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
\par         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
\par         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
\par         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
\par         for a particular purpose;
\par 
\par         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
\par         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
\par         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
\par 
\par         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
\par         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
\par         party; and
\par 
\par         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
\par         such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
\par         reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
\par         software exchange.
\par 
\par When the Program is made available in source code form:
\par 
\par     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
\par 
\par     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.  
\par Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
\par within the Program.
\par 
\par Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
\par Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
\par Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
\par 
\par 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
\par 
\par Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
\par with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
\par license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
\par Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
\par should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
\par other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
\par commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
\par hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
\par ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
\par (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
\par actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to
\par the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor
\par in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
\par product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any
\par claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
\par infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
\par 
\par     a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such
\par     claim, and
\par 
\par     b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
\par     the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
\par     negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
\par     such claim at its own expense.
\par 
\par For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
\par product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
\par Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims,
\par or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
\par warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under
\par this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims
\par against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
\par warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
\par damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
\par 
\par 5. NO WARRANTY
\par 
\par EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
\par ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
\par EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
\par CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
\par PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
\par the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes
\par all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
\par including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
\par compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
\par equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
\par 
\par 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
\par 
\par EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
\par ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
\par INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
\par WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
\par LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
\par NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION
\par OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
\par ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par 7. GENERAL
\par 
\par If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
\par applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
\par the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
\par by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
\par extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
\par 
\par If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
\par respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
\par counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
\par Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate
\par as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
\par institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim
\par or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding
\par combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
\par such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
\par Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
\par 
\par All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
\par to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
\par and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
\par becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
\par this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
\par of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
\par obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
\par relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
\par 
\par Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
\par but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
\par only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
\par the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
\par from time to time.  No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right
\par to modify this Agreement.  IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM
\par may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
\par suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given
\par a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
\par may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under
\par which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
\par is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
\par its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
\par Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses
\par to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
\par whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in
\par the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
\par 
\par This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
\par intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
\par this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
\par one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
\par to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

\par --------------- SECTION 12: GNU General Public License, V3.0 -----------
\par 
\par                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
\par 
\par  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
\par  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\par  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\par 
\par                             Preamble
\par 
\par   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
\par software and other kinds of works.
\par 
\par   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
\par to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
\par the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
\par share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
\par software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
\par GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
\par any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
\par your programs, too.
\par 
\par   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
\par price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
\par have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
\par them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
\par want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
\par free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
\par these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
\par certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
\par you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
\par 
\par   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
\par gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
\par freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
\par or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
\par know their rights.
\par 
\par   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
\par (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
\par giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
\par 
\par   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
\par that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
\par authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
\par changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
\par authors of previous versions.
\par 
\par   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
\par modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
\par can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
\par protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
\par pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
\par use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
\par have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
\par products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
\par stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
\par of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
\par 
\par   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
\par States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
\par software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
\par avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
\par make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
\par patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
\par 
\par   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par modification follow.
\par 
\par                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par   0. Definitions.
\par 
\par   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
\par 
\par   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
\par works, such as semiconductor masks.
\par 
\par   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
\par License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
\par "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
\par 
\par   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
\par in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
\par exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
\par earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
\par 
\par   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
\par on the Program.
\par 
\par   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
\par permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
\par infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
\par computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
\par distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
\par public, and in some countries other activities as well.
\par 
\par   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
\par parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
\par a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
\par 
\par   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
\par to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
\par feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
\par tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
\par extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
\par work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
\par the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
\par menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
\par 
\par   1. Source Code.
\par 
\par   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
\par for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
\par form of a work.
\par 
\par   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
\par standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
\par interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
\par is widely used among developers working in that language.
\par 
\par   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
\par than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
\par packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
\par Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
\par Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
\par implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
\par "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
\par (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
\par (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
\par produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
\par 
\par   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
\par the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
\par work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
\par control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
\par System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
\par programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
\par which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
\par includes interface definition files associated with source files for
\par the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
\par linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
\par such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
\par subprograms and other parts of the work.
\par 
\par   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
\par can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
\par Source.
\par 
\par   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
\par same work.
\par 
\par   2. Basic Permissions.
\par 
\par   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
\par copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
\par conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
\par permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
\par covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
\par content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
\par rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
\par 
\par   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
\par convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
\par in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
\par of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
\par with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
\par the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
\par not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
\par for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
\par and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
\par your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
\par 
\par   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
\par the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
\par makes it unnecessary.
\par 
\par   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
\par 
\par   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
\par measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
\par 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
\par similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
\par measures.
\par 
\par   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
\par circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
\par is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
\par the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
\par modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
\par users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
\par technological measures.
\par 
\par   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
\par 
\par   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
\par receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
\par appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
\par keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
\par non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
\par keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
\par recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
\par 
\par   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
\par and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
\par 
\par   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
\par 
\par   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
\par produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
\par terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
\par     it, and giving a relevant date.
\par 
\par     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
\par     released under this License and any conditions added under section
\par     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
\par     "keep intact all notices".
\par 
\par     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
\par     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
\par     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
\par     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
\par     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
\par     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
\par     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
\par 
\par     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
\par     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
\par     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
\par     work need not make them do so.
\par 
\par   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
\par works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
\par and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
\par in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
\par "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
\par used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
\par beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
\par in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
\par parts of the aggregate.
\par 
\par   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
\par 
\par   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
\par of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
\par machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
\par in one of these ways:
\par 
\par     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
\par     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
\par     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
\par     customarily used for software interchange.
\par 
\par     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
\par     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
\par     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
\par     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
\par     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
\par     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
\par     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
\par     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
\par     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
\par     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
\par     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
\par 
\par     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
\par     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
\par     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
\par     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
\par     with subsection 6b.
\par 
\par     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
\par     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
\par     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
\par     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
\par     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
\par     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
\par     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
\par     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
\par     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
\par     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
\par     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
\par     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
\par 
\par     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
\par     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
\par     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
\par     charge under subsection 6d.
\par 
\par   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
\par from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
\par included in conveying the object code work.
\par 
\par   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
\par tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
\par or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
\par into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
\par doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
\par product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
\par typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
\par of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
\par actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
\par is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
\par commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
\par the only significant mode of use of the product.
\par 
\par   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
\par procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
\par and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
\par a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
\par suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
\par code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
\par modification has been made.
\par 
\par   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
\par specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
\par part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
\par User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
\par fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
\par Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
\par by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
\par if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
\par modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
\par been installed in ROM).
\par 
\par   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
\par requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
\par for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
\par the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
\par network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
\par adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
\par protocols for communication across the network.
\par 
\par   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
\par in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
\par documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
\par source code form), and must require no special password or key for
\par unpacking, reading or copying.
\par 
\par   7. Additional Terms.
\par 
\par   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
\par License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
\par Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
\par be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
\par that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
\par apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
\par under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
\par this License without regard to the additional permissions.
\par 
\par   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
\par remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
\par it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
\par removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
\par additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
\par for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
\par 
\par   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
\par add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
\par that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
\par 
\par     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
\par     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
\par 
\par     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
\par     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
\par     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
\par 
\par     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
\par     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
\par     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
\par 
\par     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
\par     authors of the material; or
\par 
\par     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
\par     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
\par 
\par     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
\par     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
\par     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
\par     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
\par     those licensors and authors.
\par 
\par   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
\par restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
\par received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
\par governed by this License along with a term that is a further
\par restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
\par a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
\par License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
\par of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
\par not survive such relicensing or conveying.
\par 
\par   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
\par must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
\par additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
\par where to find the applicable terms.
\par 
\par   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
\par form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
\par the above requirements apply either way.
\par 
\par   8. Termination.
\par 
\par   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
\par provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
\par modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
\par this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
\par paragraph of section 11).
\par 
\par   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
\par license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
\par provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
\par finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
\par holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
\par prior to 60 days after the cessation.
\par 
\par   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
\par reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
\par violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
\par received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
\par copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
\par your receipt of the notice.
\par 
\par   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
\par licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
\par this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
\par reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
\par material under section 10.
\par 
\par   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
\par 
\par   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
\par run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
\par occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
\par to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
\par nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
\par modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
\par not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
\par covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
\par 
\par   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
\par 
\par   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
\par receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
\par propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
\par for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
\par 
\par   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
\par organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
\par organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
\par work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
\par transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
\par licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
\par give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
\par Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
\par the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
\par 
\par   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
\par rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
\par not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
\par rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
\par (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
\par any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
\par sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
\par 
\par   11. Patents.
\par 
\par   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
\par License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
\par work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
\par 
\par   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
\par owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
\par hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
\par by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
\par but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
\par consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
\par purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
\par patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
\par this License.
\par 
\par   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
\par patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
\par make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
\par propagate the contents of its contributor version.
\par 
\par   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
\par agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
\par (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
\par sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
\par party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
\par patent against the party.
\par 
\par   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
\par and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
\par to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
\par publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
\par then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
\par available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
\par patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
\par consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
\par license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
\par actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
\par covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
\par in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
\par country that you have reason to believe are valid.
\par 
\par   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
\par arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
\par covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
\par receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
\par or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
\par you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
\par work and works based on it.
\par 
\par   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
\par the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
\par conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
\par specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
\par work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
\par in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
\par to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
\par the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
\par parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
\par patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
\par conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
\par for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
\par contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
\par or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
\par 
\par   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
\par any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
\par otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
\par 
\par   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
\par 
\par   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
\par otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
\par excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
\par covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
\par License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
\par not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
\par to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
\par the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
\par License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
\par 
\par   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
\par 
\par   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
\par permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
\par under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
\par combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
\par License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
\par but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
\par section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
\par combination as such.
\par 
\par   14. Revised Versions of this License.
\par 
\par   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
\par the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
\par be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
\par address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
\par Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
\par Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
\par option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
\par version or of any later version published by the Free Software
\par Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
\par GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
\par by the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
\par versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
\par public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
\par to choose that version for the Program.
\par 
\par   Later license versions may give you additional or different
\par permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
\par author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
\par later version.
\par 
\par   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
\par 
\par   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
\par APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
\par HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
\par OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
\par THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
\par PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
\par IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
\par ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par   16. Limitation of Liability.
\par 
\par   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
\par WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
\par THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
\par GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
\par USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
\par DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
\par PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
\par EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
\par SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
\par 
\par   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
\par above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
\par reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
\par an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
\par Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
\par copy of the Program in return for a fee.
\par 
\par                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\par 
\par   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
\par possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
\par free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
\par 
\par   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
\par to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
\par state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
\par the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
\par     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
\par 
\par     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
\par     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
\par     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
\par     (at your option) any later version.
\par 
\par     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
\par     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
\par     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
\par     GNU General Public License for more details.
\par 
\par     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
\par     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
\par notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
\par 
\par     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
\par     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
\par     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
\par     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
\par 
\par The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
\par parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
\par might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
\par 
\par   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
\par if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
\par For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
\par <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
\par 
\par   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
\par into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
\par may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
\par the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
\par Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
\par <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
