8.    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION. 

8.1 Defense and Indemnification.  Subject to the remainder of this Section 8, 
VMware shall defend You against any third party claim that the Software 
infringes any patent, trademark or copyright of such third party, or 
misappropriates a trade secret (but only to the extent that such 
misappropriation is not a result of Your actions) under the laws of: (a) the 
United States and Canada; (b) the European Economic Area; (c) Australia; (d) 
New Zealand; (e) Japan; or (f) the People's Republic of China, to the extent 
that such countries are part of the Territory for the License ("Infringement 
Claim") and indemnify You from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded 
against You to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed 
to in settlement; provided that You:  (i) promptly provide VMware with notice 
of such Infringement Claim; (ii) allow VMware sole control over the defense 
thereof and related settlement negotiation; and (iii) reasonably cooperate in 
response to VMware requests for assistance.  You may not settle or compromise 
any Infringement Claim without the prior written consent of VMware.

8.2 Remedies.  Should the Software become, or in VMware's opinion be likely to

and expense either:  (a) procure the rights necessary for You to make 
continued use of the affected Software in accordance with this EULA; (b) 
replace or modify the affected Software to make it non-infringing; or (c) 
terminate the License to the affected Software and discontinue the related 
support services, and, upon Your certified deletion of the affected Software, 
refund: (i) the fees paid by You for the License to the affected Software, 
less straight-line depreciation over a three (3) year useful life beginning on 
the date such Software was delivered; and (ii) any pre-paid service fee 
attributable to related support services to be delivered after the date such 
service is stopped. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall limit VMware's 
obligation under Section 8.1 to defend and indemnify You, provided that You 
replace the allegedly infringing Software upon VMware's making alternate 
Software available to You and/or You discontinue using the allegedly 
infringing Software upon receiving VMware's notice terminating the affected 
License.

8.3 Exclusions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, VMware will have no obligation 
under this Section 8 or otherwise with respect to any claim based on:  (a) a 
combination of Software with non-VMware products (other than non-VMware 
products that are listed on the Order and used in an unmodified form); (b) use 
for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software was not designed; (c) use 
of any older version of the Software when use of a newer VMware revision would 
have avoided the infringement; (d) any modification to the Software made 
without VMware's express written approval; (e) any claim that relates to open 
source software or freeware technology or any derivatives or other adaptations 
thereof that is not embedded by VMware into Software listed on VMware's 
commercial price list; (f) any claim that relates to Linux or Android open

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN

JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.  VMWARE'S AND ITS LICENSORS' LIABILITY UNDER THIS EULA WILL NOT, IN ANY 
EVENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT
